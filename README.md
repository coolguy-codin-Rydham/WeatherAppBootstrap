This project is a part of my college curriculum. I appreciate this project a lot because I got to learn a lot of things during the making of the same.

This Weather App is a client-side HTML, CSS, JavaScript application that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specified city. It utilizes asynchronous functions and event listeners to handle user input from a search form. Upon submission, it fetches weather data for the entered city, processes the response, and dynamically updates the UI to display relevant weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and perceived temperature. Additionally, it adjusts the background image based on whether it's day or night in the queried location. The code demonstrates efficient handling of API requests and seamless integration of data into the user interface, providing a simple yet effective weather forecast tool for users.

Well If this Project helps get me a cup of coffee :). 


PS: I hate Bootstrap. Please hate it with me.
